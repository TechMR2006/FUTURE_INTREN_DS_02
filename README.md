🏢 Project Context: Future Interns | Data Science & Analytics Internship 

💡 Project Vision

I developed an end-to-end business intelligence solution to transform raw sales data from "EcoMart" into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. This project goes beyond simple reporting; it provides actionable insights to drive strategic decisions, optimize operations, and boost profitability.

🎯 Core Objectives & Achievements

📈 Tracked Critical KPIs: Visualized key metrics like Total Revenue 💰, Profit Margin ✅, and Average Order Value 🛒 to provide a 360° view of business health.

📦 Identified Top Performers: Pinpointed the most profitable product categories and customer segments, revealing key opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory management.

🗺️ Unlocked Regional Insights: Mapped sales data to identify high-performing regions and areas for potential growth.

📊 Delivered Actionable Intelligence: Created a tool that empowers stakeholders to move from data to decisions quickly and confidently.

🛠️ My Tech Stack

Power BI: Architected and deployed a fully interactive dashboard with advanced filtering, drill-through capabilities, and compelling data storytelling.

Power Query (ETL): Executed robust data cleaning, transformation, and shaping to ensure data integrity and model efficiency.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Authored complex calculated measures and columns (e.g., Profit Margin, YTD Sales) to uncover insights not visible in the raw data.

✨ Dashboard Features & Key Insights

Executive Summary Page: A high-level, "at-a-glance" view of overall business performance, perfect for leadership.

Deep-Dive Analysis Page: An in-depth look at product performance, sales trends over time, and customer behavior patterns.

Interactive Controls: Users can dynamically filter by date, region, product category, and customer segment to explore the data for themselves.

Clear Visualizations: Utilized a mix of charts, maps, and KPIs to present complex information in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format.
